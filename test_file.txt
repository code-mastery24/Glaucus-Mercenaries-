Welcome to the May 2025 release of Visual Studio Code. This version includes several updates that we hope you'll appreciate. Some of the key highlights include:

So, if we wanted to type 'git st' and have it function like 'git status', we would type 'git config alias'.st status. Now we can type git st and have the same output as if we typed git status.

If you would like your alias to be a part of your global configuration, add the --global command after git config. For example, to alias git i to git init globally, you would type git config --global alias.i init.


Gomycode Institute is an institute that stands out among other institutes. It is indeed an amazing one.
